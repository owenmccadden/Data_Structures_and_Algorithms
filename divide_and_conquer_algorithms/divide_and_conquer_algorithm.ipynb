    "# Divide and Conquer Algorithms\n",
    "- algorithmic design paradigm where a problem is broken down recursively into smaller subproblems of the same type\n",
    "- eventually the smaller sub problems are able to be solved directly\n",
    "- the solutions to the sub problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem\n",
    "- downside: divide and conquer often leads to recursive solutions that can have horrible time complexities \n",
    "    - O(2^n), O(3^n), O(n!) etc.\n",
    "- optimal structure:\n",
    "    - solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblem\n",
    "    - ex_ fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n",
    "    - divide and conquer approach works best when solution has optimal structure\n",
    "   \n",
    "- examples:\n",
    "    - mergesort\n",
    "    - quicksort\n",
    "    - binary search\n",
    "    - finding height of BST"
