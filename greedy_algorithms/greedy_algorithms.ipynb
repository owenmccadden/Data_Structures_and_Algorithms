    "- algorithmic paradigm that builds the solution piece by piece\n",
    "- at each step of the algorithm, select the best step available at the time that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit\n",

    "### Examples:\n",
    "- insertion sort\n",
    "    - divide array into two parts: sorted and unsorted\n",
    "    - in each step we grab the next element from the unsorted portion and put it into the correct position in the sorted section\n",
    "    - in each step we are finding the local optimal step, which ultimately leads to the global optimal solution\n",
    "- selection sort\n",
    "    - likewise we divide the array into an unsorted section and a sorted section\n",
    "    - at each step we find the minimum value and swap it with the first value in the sorted section\n",
    "    - find the locally optimal step which leads us to globally optimal solution\n",
    "- topological sort\n",
    "- prim's algorithm\n",
    "- kruskal algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- each of these algorithms perform the locally optimal step which leads to the globally optimal solution to the problem"
